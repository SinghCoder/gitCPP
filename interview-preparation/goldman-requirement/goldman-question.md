# Goldman Question

#### **Tech Questions from Goldman Interviews**

You are given the opportunity to select one closed door of three, behind one of which there is a prize. The other two doors hide piles of rubble. Once you have made your selection, the gameshow host \(called Monty\) Hall will open one of the remaining doors, revealing that it does not contain the prize. He then asks you if you would like to switch your selection to the other unopened door, or stay with your original choice. Here is the problem. What do you do? [\(This is known as the Monty Hall problem.\)](https://www.montyhallproblem.com/)
