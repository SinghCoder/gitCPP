* Exception translation into Spring’s portable Data Access Exception hierarchy.
* Feature Rich Object Mapping integrated with Spring’s Conversion Service.
* Annotation based mapping metadata but extensible to support other metadata formats.
* Automatic implementation of Repository interfaces including support for custom finder methods \(backed by Couchbase Views\).
