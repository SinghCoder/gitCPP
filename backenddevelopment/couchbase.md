# CouchBase



Couchbase is the merge of two popular NOSQL technologies:   


* Membase, which provides persistence, replication, sharding to the high performance memcached technology
* CouchDB, which pioneers the document oriented model based on JSON



Like other NOSQL technologies, both Membase and CouchDB are built from the ground up on a highly distributed architecture, with data shard across machines in a cluster. Built around the Memcached protocol, Membase provides an easy migration to existing Memcached users who want to add persistence, sharding and fault resilience on their familiar Memcached model. On the other hand, CouchDB provides first class support for storing JSON documents as well **as a simple RESTful API** to access them. Underneath, CouchDB also has a highly tuned storage engine that is optimized for both update transaction as well as query processing. Taking the best of both technologies, Membase is well-positioned in the NOSQL marketplace.
