# KERNEL VS CPU

The kernel is part of the Operating System \(OS\), which usually is Windows, using DOS, or a Unix-based OS like Linux or Mac. The computer is made of a lot of different modules: memory, CPU, fans, USBs, HDDs, printers, PCI-E cards... and the operations to interact with these modules must be loaded every second the computer is on, because failing to do so would make a module useless too.

This kernel is the code that manages EVERYTHING on your computer, by using the CPU. If you need to access an HDD to play a game or read a PDF file, the kernel will talk to the HDD and this will allow your OS to know what files are on the HDD and how to open them. If you read a DVD to watch a movie, the kernell will open the SATA connection, see that the connected device is a DVD, and tell Windows how to read it. If any of these processes need to store more memory, save temporal files, or perform a GPU operation, the kernel will be allowing and managing it to do so.

So, while the CPU is the hardware component that does operations, the kernel is a software written by really expert people that tries to manage everything from behind while using the least memory possible and consuming the least CPU resources it can.
