* **Step 1 \(SYN\) :** In the first step, client wants to establish a connection with server, so it sends a segment with SYN\(Synchronize Sequence Number\) which informs server that client is likely to start communication and with what sequence number it starts segments with
* **Step 2 \(SYN + ACK\):** Server responds to the client request with SYN-ACK signal bits set. Acknowledgement\(ACK\) signifies the response of segment it received and SYN signifies with what sequence number it is likely to start the segments with
* **Step 3 \(ACK\) :** In the final part client acknowledges the response of server and they both establish a reliable connection with which they will start the actual data transfer

  The steps 1, 2 establish the connection parameter \(sequence number\) for one direction and it is acknowledged. The steps 2, 3 establish the connection parameter \(sequence number\) for the other direction and it is acknowledged. With these, a full-duplex communication is established.

  **Note â€“** Initial sequence numbers are randomly selected while establishing connections between client and server.
