# TCP/IP

TCP/IP stands for **T**ransmission **C**ontrol **P**rotocol / **I**nternet **P**rotocol.

### Inside TCP/IP

Inside the TCP/IP standard there are several protocols for handling data communication:

* TCP \(Transmission Control Protocol\) communication between **applications**
* UDP \(User Datagram Protocol\) simple communication between **applications**
* IP \(Internet Protocol\) communication between **computers**
* ICMP \(Internet Control Message Protocol\) for errors and statistics
* DHCP \(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\) for dynamic addressing



**TCP and IP need to work together ..**

TCP take care of communication between applications and breaking data down into IP packets before they are sent.

IP takes care of communication with other computers and sending packets to the correct destination.

**TCP/IP uses 32 bits, or four numbers between 0 and 255, to address a computer.**

TCP/UDP extends the Host-to-Host transportation by IP service and make it process-to-process delivery \(Transport Layer Multiplexing\)

### 

### 32 Bits = 4 Bytes

TCP/IP uses 32 bits addressing. One computer byte is 8 bits. So TCP/IP uses 4 computer bytes.

A computer byte can contain 256 different values:

00000000, 00000001, 00000010, 00000011, 00000100, 00000101, 00000110, 00000111, 00001000 .......and all the way up to 11111111.

Now you know why a TCP/IP address is four numbers between 0 and 255.
