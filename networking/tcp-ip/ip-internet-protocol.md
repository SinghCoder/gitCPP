# IP \(internet protocol\)

provides datagram service \(packets are handled and delivered independently\)

best-effort protocol \( may loose, reordered or duplicate packets\)

each packet must contain an IP address of its destination.



IP is connection less 

it's used for communication between computers

it does not occupy communication line between two computers. It reduces the need for network lines.

each line can be used for communication between many different computers at same time.

messages are broken up into small independent packets and transmitted via internet. \(breaking message to packets done by TCP, routing done by IP\)

IP is responsible for routing packet to correct destination \( done by the router \)
