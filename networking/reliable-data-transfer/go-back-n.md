# Go Back N

Now what exactly happens in GBN, we will explain with a help of example. Consider the diagram given below. We have sender window size of 4. Assume that we have lots of sequence numbers just for the sake of explanation. Now the sender has sent the packets 0, 1, 2 and 3. After acknowledging the packets 0 and 1, receiver is now expecting packet 2 and sender window has also slided to further transmit the packets 4 and 5. Now suppose the packet 2 is lost in the network, Receiver will discard all the packets which sender has transmitted after packet 2 as it is expecting sequence number of 2. On the sender side for every packet send there is a time out timer which will expire for packet number 2. Now from the last transmitted packet 5 sender will go back to the packet number 2 in the current window and transmit all the packets till packet number 5. Thatâ€™s why it is called Go Back N. Go back means sender has to go back N places from the last transmitted packet in the unacknowledged window and not from the point where the packet is lost.
