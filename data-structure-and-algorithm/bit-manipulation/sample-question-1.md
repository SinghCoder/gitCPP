# Sample Question 1

**Your company delivers breakfast via autonomous quadcopter drones. And something mysterious has happened.**

Each breakfast delivery is assigned a unique ID, a positive integer. When one of the company's 100 drones takes off with a delivery, the delivery's ID is added to a vector, deliveryIdConfirmations. When the drone comes back and lands, the ID is again added to the same vector.

After breakfast this morning there were only 99 drones on the tarmac. One of the drones never made it back from a delivery. **We suspect a secret agent from Amazon placed an order and** _**stole**_ **one of our patented drones**. To track them down, we need to find their delivery ID.

**Given the vector of IDs, which contains many duplicate integers and** _**one unique integer**_**, find the unique integer.**

_The IDs are **not** guaranteed to be sorted or sequential. Orders aren't always fulfilled in the order they were received, and some deliveries get cancelled before takeoff._

\_\_

#### Solution

We XOR â†´ all the integers in the vector. We start with a variable uniqueDeliveryId set to 00. Every time we XOR with a new ID, it will change the bits. When we XOR with the same ID again, it will cancel out the earlier change.

In the end, we'll be left with the ID that appeared once!

```cpp
  int findUniqueDeliveryId(const vector<int>& deliveryIds)
{
    int uniqueDeliveryId = 0;

    for (int deliveryId : deliveryIds) {
        uniqueDeliveryId ^= deliveryId;
    }

    return uniqueDeliveryId;
}
```
