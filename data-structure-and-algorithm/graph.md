# Graph

tree is also considered a graph.

connected graph -&gt; if there's a path between any pair of nodes 

acyclic graph -&gt; graph without cycles 

Representing Graph 

-&gt; 1. use adjacent matrix , true value indicate path existence

-&gt; 2. use adjacent list, every nodes stores a list of adjacent list \(array of list\)

e.g.

  
p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 7.5px Helvetica}  
p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 9.0px Helvetica}
