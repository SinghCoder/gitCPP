Full tree - all nodes except leaves are fully filled

Complete Tree - all nodes except leaves trees filled to the leaves, and the last level is filled from left to right .

Binary Tree - a tree which each node has at most 2 children nodes 

Binary Search Tree - a binary tree where all left children are smaller than the right children \( need to clarify if the tree can contain duplicates\) 

Full Binary Tree - every node has either 0 or 2 children 

Perfect binary tree - full and complete binary tree \(exactly 2^K-1\) nodes

InOrder Traversal - print left node, center then right node 

PreOrder Traversal - print center node, then left node then right node 

PostOrder Traversal - print left, print right , print center 

AVL Tree -&gt; a Binary Search Tree where the difference in height between left and right subtree is at most one.
