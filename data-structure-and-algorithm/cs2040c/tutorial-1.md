**Some Maths** 

Harmonic Series 

For F\(n\), it is n \* \(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n\)

The series in the bracket is a harmonic series which converges to log \(n\)

Geometric Series 

G\(n\) is a geometric progression a\*r^x where a \(initial term\) = n, r \(ratio\) = 0.5. Formula for sum of terms, assuming large n, is a/\(1-r\)
