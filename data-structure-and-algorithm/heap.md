# Heap

min heap -&gt; complete binary tree with root as the minimum node of all.

extraction of min element -&gt; remove the minimum and swap the value with right most children at bottom, and bubbles down o\(logn\)

trie -&gt; prefix tree, each node can put a character, with ending node as \*. trie can search a string in o\(k\) time where k is the length of the string.
