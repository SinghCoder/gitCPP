# 4 Week Interview Plan

## Week 1 — Arrays and Strings <a id="65c8"></a>

Arrays and Strings are like the bread and butter of coding problems. While they are basic structures, they can easily get complicated and test you on more complex concepts.

### Goal for the week: get into the ‘algorithm’ mindset and feel comfortable with basic data structures. Refresh your memory on basic concepts like recursion/binary search and handling off-by-one errors. <a id="2072"></a>

It’s likely you haven’t touched on these kinds of problems for a while so this week will mostly be for you to ‘ease’ into the next few weeks of technical review.

**5 highly suggested review questions \(in order of difficulty\)**

[~~Valid Parenthesis~~](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)~~~~

[~~Reverse Vowels in String~~](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/description/)~~~~

[~~Isomorphic Strings~~](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/description/)~~~~

[Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)

[Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/description/)
