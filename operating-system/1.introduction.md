**Dual mode** operation allows OS to protect itself and other system components

* **User mode** and **kernel mode** 
* **Mode bit** provided by hardware

a. Provides ability to distinguish when system is running user code or kernel code

b. Some instructions designated as **privileged**, only executable in kernel mode

c. System call changes mode to kernel, return from call resets it to user
