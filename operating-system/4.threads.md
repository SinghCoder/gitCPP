# 4.threads

A **thread** is a basic unit of CPU utilization consisting of a program counter, register set, a stack., local data, and other threadspecific properties. It is also called a **lightweight process** \(**LWP**\). In contrast, a traditional process is a **heavyweight** process.

Threads can share the context of their parents, and hence siblings can share context, and thus a whole process tree can share it. E.g. can share code, variables, open files, data.

The collection of all threads is called a **task**.

**Benefits of threads**

**Responsiveness**: multithreading an application increases responsiveness. One thread can issue I/O request and be blocked while another does computation. While data loads, another user request may be satisfied.

**Resource Sharing**: threads share memory and resources without special OS primitives like messagepassing or shared memory system calls, making it easier and faster. **BUT** â€“ puts burden on programer to prevent race conditions \(Chapter 6\)

**Economy**: much faster to create a thread than a process; also because resources are shared, fewer resources are used in total.

**Scalability**: threads can be scheduled on separate processors when they are available, making execution faster. So can processes, but they require more resources, so mroe threads can be scheduled than processors, when the number of processors is very large.

**Thread library provides programmer with API for creating and managing threads**

Two primary ways of implementing

1\) Library entirely in user space

2\) Kernel level library supported by the OS

Linux refers to them as tasks rather than threads

**clone\(\)** allows a child task to share the address space of the parent task \(process\)
