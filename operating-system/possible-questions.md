CPU

brain of the computer. It ensures the functioning of all components in the computer. CPU consists of two subsystems: [Arithmetic and Logic Unit \(ALU\)](https://pediaa.com/difference-between-cpu-and-alu/#ALU) and Control Unit \(CU\).  ALU handles all arithmetic and logical operations. It performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. The logical operations determine the logic of the statements, i.e., whether they are true or false, etc. Control Unit \(CU\) regulates and synchronizes the operations of the computer. Moreover, there are CPU registers to store fetched instructions and the results.

CPU is also referred as the processor. The computer architecture helps to determine whether the CPU can process [32bit or 64bit](https://pediaa.com/difference-between-32-bit-and-64-bit/) instructions. The clock speed indicates the number of instructions the CPU can process within a second. The execution time for the CPU to execute a program can be calculated using the following formula.

**CPU time = No of instructions in the program x Clock cycles per instructions x Time for one clock cycle**

Core

A core is an execution unit of a CPU. This unit is capable of reading and executing instructions. CPU or the processor can have a single core or multiple cores. When a system has more cores, it is called a multicore system. A CPU with two cores is called a dual-core processor. A CPU with four cores is called a quad-core processor.

When there are multiple cores in a single CPU, it can receive many instructions and execute them on separate cores simultaneously. It increases the processing speed. Therefore, the number of cores in the CPU is a considerable factor in determining the performance of the CPU. It also implements parallel computing. The latest computers use multicore processors. It consists of single computing components with two or more processing units or cores to read and execute multiple instructions at a time.
