Problem description 
====================
Cut and paste is one of the most common operations we use in everyday computing. 

In this task, you are to write a program that will simulate the use of cut and paste for characters in a string. 

For simplicity, we are going to simulate this operation with only one character at a time. 

Input
======
The first line of input consist of a string. This is the original string. 

The next line contains a single integer n. This is the number of cut-and-paste operations. 

Each of the subsequent n lines contain 2 integers s and d. The source character is the s-th character of the current string. Position d represents the destination of the paste operation. You are to paste the character after the current d-th character of the string. If you are required to paste the character at the start of the string, d will be 0. 

Output
======
For each operation, output the resulting string. The next operation will continue from this string.
