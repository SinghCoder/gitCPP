==Description==
Your first programming job at ACME Inc is to write part of the new text 
editor the company is building. Specifically your job is to write the 
part of the editor which stores and manipulates the text given a series 
of keypresses from the user. As this is the alpha version of the new 
text editor, your manager only expects you to implement a subset of the 
functionality planned for the editor. 

Note that the behaviour of your text editor should be the same as that 
of the Notepad program distributed with MS Windows. 

==Input Format==
The input consists of a single line of characters indicating keypresses. 
The characters that will appear are the letters of the alphabet, numbers, 
'<', '>' and '^'. The alphabets and numbers represents the usual keys on 
a keyboard, the '<' character represents the left button on the directional 
pad, the '>' represents the right button on the directional pad and the 
'^' character represents the delete button. (Deletes the character to the 
right of cursor.)

==Output Format==
Assuming we started with an empty text file, you are to output the result 
of executing the given string of keypresses on the text editor.
