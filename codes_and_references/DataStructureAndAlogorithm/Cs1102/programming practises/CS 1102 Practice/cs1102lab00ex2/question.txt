Lab 0 Ex1: Unix Commands 
========================  

Instructions 
============ 
1. This is our introductory lab and this exercise
   contributes to the 2%.
2. You must pass all the tests in courseMarker.
  

Description: 
============
This is a simple practice to familiarize you with sunfire
environment. Sunfire server uses Solaris as Operating System (just
like Windows XP/Vista is the Operating System on your laptop/PC).
Solaris is a variant on the Unix Operating System (other famous
variant would be Linux). As Solaris is very different from Windows,
this exercise is to help you to get use to a few basic commands which
should be sufficient for you use in CS1102.

In Windows, you are used to rely on GUI (Graphical User Interface) to
perform some basic tasks. For example, you should have no problem using
the Windows Explorer (or "My Computer") to create a folder, create file,
remove file, move file etc. In Solaris, these commands are usually
performed from user prompt (i.e. "text" input at command prompt). You
can refer to Part 1 of Walkthrough regarding the basic commands.

Before you attempt the exercise, there is one more clarification. Unix
commands are NOT part of Java. However, due to the limitation of
CourseMarker, which can only check Java program, we are forced to use a
Java program to record your answer to the exercises below. 

Together with this question, you should see a Java file
"Unix.Java", which contains the following code fragment:

   switch (questionNo){

        case 1:                 //Question 1
            System.out.println("???????");       
            break; 

        ......
    }

Your task is to simply place the response to the unix commands below in
the println message. If the unix command does not give any message, you
should place the word "NONE" in the message.


Exercise on Unix Commands
=========================

We are going to carry out a few commands step-by-step below. Some of the
steps have the word (Question X) at the end, which indicates that you
should record the reponse and put them in the correponding  "case" in
the unixPractice.cpp. If you suspect you have mistype a command, please 
refer to the section on "Resetting the Exercise".

Step 1  Go to your home directory by typing "cd"
        
Step 2 (Question 1). Enter "ls testUnixDir"
        Meaning: "ls" is to list the content of current folder
                  if you place a name behind it (as in this case), you 
                   are simply checking whether a file/folder by that name exist.
        Hint: You shouldnt have this file/folder 

Step 3  Enter "mkdir testUnixDir"
        Meaning: "mkdir" is to create a new directory (folder).
                 "testUnixDir" is the name of the folder.

Step 4 (Question 2). Enter "ls testUnixDir"
        This is the same comamnd used in Step 2, however, after step 3,
        the response should be different! If the name given to "ls" is a
         valid folder, the command will then list out the content of the folder.

Step 5  Enter "cd testUnixDir"
        Meaning: "cd" is to change (go into) a directory, in this case,
        we are going into the newly created folder "testUnixDir".

Step 6  Create a new file "abc.txt" by using your favorite editor (vim,
        pico etc). If you are new to sunfire, try to read through the
        relevant section in the Walkthrough Part 1 regarding this.

        Just type "ABCDEFGH" in the file and save it.

Step 7 (Question 3).  Enter "ls"

Step 8  Enter "cp abc.txt another.txt"
        Meaning: "cp" is to make a new copy of an existing file. In this
                 case, we are duplicating "abc.txt" and name it as
                 "another.txt".
        You can check whether you are correct up to this step by typing
        "ls". Two files "abc.txt another.txt" should be listed.

Step 9  (Question 4). Enter "diff abc.txt another.txt"
        Meaning: "diff" is used to compare the content of two files.
                 This command will show the _differences_ between the
                 files if any.

Step 10 Enter "rm abc.txt"
        If prompted, type "y" to confirm the command
        Meaning: "rm" is used for file removal. 

Step 11 Enter "mv another.txt ABC.txt"
        Meaning: "mv" means "move". One main use is to move a file to
                 another folder, or you can use it to rename a file
                 (which is what we are doing here).

Step 12 (Question 5). Enter "ls"


Resetting this Exercise
=======================

Only go through the following if you think you have make a mistake that
cannot be rectified in the steps above.

The command listed down here is quite dangerous. Make sure you type them
EXACTLY as shown.

Step 1. Go to your home directory by typing "cd"

Step 2. Check whether you have the folder used for this exercise:
        Enter "ls testUnixDir". ONLY perform the next step if you see
        textUnixDir listed.

Step 3. Enter "rm -Rf textUnixDir". Make sure you type it EXACTLY as
        shown. 

Perform Step 2 again, you should see no output on screen. You can down
redo the exercise.
