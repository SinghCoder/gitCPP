PE Ex2: Tree Planting
=====================

In this problem, you will be given two BSTs, T1 and T2, 
and you need to determine whether it is possible to set 
the root node of T2 to be a child node of some node of 
T1, such that the resultant tree is a BST. 

For simplicity, each of the BSTs stores distinct integers, 
and no integer appear in both BSTs. 


Input 
=====

The first line contains a single integer indicating the 
number of nodes in T1. 
The second line contains a pre-order traversal sequence 
for the values in T1. 
The third line contains a single integer indicating the 
number of nodes in T2.
The fourth line contains a pre-order traversal sequence 
for the values in T2. 


Output 
======

Print YES in a single line if T2 can be joined to T1 to 
form a BST, otherwise print NO in a single line.
