[When do we need to use initialisation list ?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/when-do-we-use-initializer-list-in-c/)

* for initialisation of non-static const data members 
* for initialisation of reference members 
* for initialisation of objects which do not have default constructor 
* for initialisation of base class members 

when should we use explicit constructor ?

* to avoid behind-the-scene type conversions.
