* [difference between Process and Threads](https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-process-and-thread.html)

A process is the execution of a program that allows you to perform the appropriate actions specified in a program. It can be defined as an execution unit where a program runs. The OS helps you to create, schedule, and terminates the processes which is used by CPU. The other processes created by the main process are called child process.

A process operations can be easily controlled with the help of PCB\(Process Control Block\). You can consider it as the brain of the process, which contains all the crucial information related to processing like process id, priority, state, and contents CPU register, etc.

| **Parameter** | **Process** | **Thread** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Definition | Process means a program is in execution. | Thread means a segment of a process. |
| Lightweight | The process is not Lightweight. | Threads are Lightweight. |
| Termination time | The process takes more time to terminate. | The thread takes less time to terminate. |
| Creation time | It takes more time for creation. | It takes less time for creation. |
| Communication | Communication between processes needs more time compared to thread. | Communication between threads requires less time compared to processes. |
| Context switching time | It takes more time for context switching. | It takes less time for context switching. |
| Resource | Process consume more resources. | Thread consume fewer resources. |
| Treatment by OS | Different process are tread separately by OS. | All the level peer threads are treated as a single task by OS. |
| Memory | The process is mostly isolated. | Threads share memory. |
| Sharing | It does not share data | Threads share data with each other. |

* **Creating a separate thread in JVM**

construct a new Thread object and takes in an instance of Runnable interface 

```java

public class Test {
	
	
	
	public static void main(String []args) {
		Thread sepThread = new Thread(new ThreadPrinter());
		sepThread.start();
		
		for(int i=0; i < 5; i++) {
			System.out.println("From main thread  " +  Thread.currentThread().getName());
			try {
				Thread.sleep(1000);
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
				// TODO Auto-generated catch block
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}
	}
}

 class ThreadPrinter implements Runnable{

	@Override
	public void run() {
		for(int i=0; i < 5; i++) {
			System.out.println("From the new thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
			
			try {
				Thread.sleep(1000);
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
				// TODO Auto-generated catch block
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}
		
	}
	
}

```

* [what is an executor ](https://www.baeldung.com/java-executor-service-tutorial)

helps to manage thread pool creation and usage, by calling the execute method

```java


public class Test {
	
	
	
	public static void main(String []args) {
		Executor executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
		executor.execute(new ThreadPrinter());
		executor.execute(new ThreadPrinter());
	}
}

 class ThreadPrinter implements Runnable{

	@Override
	public void run() {
		for(int i=0; i < 5; i++) {
			System.out.println("From the new thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
			
			try {
				Thread.sleep(1000);
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
				// TODO Auto-generated catch block
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}
		
	}
	
}
```



The _**execute\(\)**_ method is _void,_ and it doesn't give any possibility to get the result of task's execution or to check the task's status \(is it running or executed\).

```text
executorService.execute(runnableTask);
```

_**submit\(\)**_ submits a _Callable_ or a _Runnable_ task to an _ExecutorService_ and returns a result of type _Future_.

```text
Future<String> future =   executorService.submit(callableTask);
```

_**invokeAny\(\)**_ assigns a collection of tasks to an _ExecutorService,_ causing each to be executed, and returns the result of a successful execution of one task \(if there was a successful execution\)_._

```text
String result = executorService.invokeAny(callableTasks);
```

_**invokeAll\(\)**_ assigns a collection of tasks to an _ExecutorService,_ causing each to be executed, and returns the result of all task executions in the form of a list of objects of type _Future._

```text
List<Future<String>> futures = executorService.invokeAll(callableTasks);
```



* how do you lock the shared data ?

use synchronized keyword
