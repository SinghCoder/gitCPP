[What is Internet ?](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/22/what-is-the-internet-13-key-questions-answered)

The internet is the wider network that allows computer networks around the world run by companies, governments, universities and other organisations to talk to one another. The result is a mass of cables, computers, data centres, routers, servers, repeaters, satellites and wifi towers that allows digital information to travel around the world.

It is that infrastructure that lets you order the weekly shop, share your life on Facebook, stream Outcast on Netflix, email your aunt in Wollongong and search the web for the worldâ€™s tiniest cat.



[What is HTTP and how it's evolved ?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)

**HTTP** is a [protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol) which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.
