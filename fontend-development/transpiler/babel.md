# Babel

Babel is not a new language but a transpiler that transpiles next generation JavaScript with features not yet available to all browsers \([ES2015](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) and beyond\) to older more compatible JavaScript \(ES5\).Typescript is a language that is essentially identical to next generation JavaScript, but also adds optional static typing. Many people choose to use babel because itâ€™s closest to vanilla JavaScript.
