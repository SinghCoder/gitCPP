# Jest/Enzyme

#### Introduction To Jest <a id="introduction-to-jest"></a>

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) is a delightful JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity. It can be installed with npm or Yarn. Jest fits into a broader category of utilities known as [test runners](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-test-runner). It works great for React applications, but it also works great outside of React applications.

[Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) is a library that is used to test React applications. Itâ€™s designed to test components, and it makes it possible to write assertions that simulate actions that confirm whether the UI is working correctly.

Jest and Enzyme complement each other so well, so in this article we will be using both.
