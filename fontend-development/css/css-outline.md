# CSS Outline

### CSS Outline

An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, OUTSIDE the borders, to make the element "stand out".

CSS has the following outline properties:

* `outline-style`
* `outline-color`
* `outline-width`
* `outline-offset`
* `outline`

**Note:** Outline differs from [borders](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp)! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.

### CSS Outline Style

The `outline-style` property specifies the style of the outline, and can have one of the following values:

* `dotted` - Defines a dotted outline
* `dashed` - Defines a dashed outline
* `solid` - Defines a solid outline
* `double` - Defines a double outline
* `groove` - Defines a 3D grooved outline
* `ridge` - Defines a 3D ridged outline
* `inset` - Defines a 3D inset outline
* `outset` - Defines a 3D outset outline
* `none` - Defines no outline
* `hidden` - Defines a hidden outline

The following example shows the different `outline-style` values:
