# Eslint

[`eslint`](https://eslint.org/) is the dominant tool for linting Node.js packages, and can be configured to enforce multiple coding styles. It is possible to define your own style definitions, but here I will show how to use the StrongLoop style. There are [others](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=eslint-config-), but StrongLoopâ€™s style is unremarkable \(a good thing, coding style should not attract attention\), and is similar to that used in many open-source Node.js projects.
