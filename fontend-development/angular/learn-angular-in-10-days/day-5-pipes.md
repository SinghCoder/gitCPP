# Day 5 - Pipes

helps to format the data into needed format e.g. lower case, upper case 



### Basic Pipes

  
Most of the pipes provided by Angular 8 will be familiar with us if we already worked in the previous Angular version. Actually, pipes do not provide any new features in Angular 8. In Angular 8, we can use logic in the template. We can define any function within the pipe class to implement any special type data conversion or business login and then execute that particular function from the HTML template to obtain the desired result. The syntax of the Pipe in the HTML template begins with the input value and then followed the pipe symbol \(\|\) and then need to provide the pipe name. The parameters of that pipe can be sent separately by a colon \(:\). The order of execution of a pipe is right to left. In General, Pipe is working within the HTML only. The most commonly used built-in pipes are:

* Currency 
* Date 
* Uppercase 
* Lowercase 
* JSON 
* Decimal 
* Percent 
* Async
