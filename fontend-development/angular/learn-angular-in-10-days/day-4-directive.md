# Day 4 - Directive

In general, a directive is a TypeScript based function that executes whenever Angular compiler identified it within the DOM element. Directives are used to provide or generate new HTML based syntax which will extend the power of the UI in an Angular Application. Each directive must have a selector name just like the same as a component â€“ either that name can be from Angular predefined patterns like ng-if or a custom developer-defined name which can be any name but need to indicate the main purpose of the directive. Also, every directive can act as an element or an attribute or a class or a comment in the HTML section.
