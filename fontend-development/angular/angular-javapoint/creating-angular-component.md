### Creating component with CLI

### Syntax

2. Or  
3. ng g c component\_name  

Let's see how to create a new component by using command line.

Open Command prompt and stop **ng serve** command if it is running on the browser.

Type **ng generate component server2** to create a new component named server2.

You can also use a shortcut **ng g c server2** to do the same task.
