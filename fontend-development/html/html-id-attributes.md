# HTML id Attributes

The HTML `id` attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.

You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.

### Using The id Attribute

The `id` attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the `id` attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

The `id` attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.

The syntax for id is: write a hash character \(\#\) character, followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.

In the following example we have an `<h1>` element that points to the id name "myHeader". This `<h1>` element will be styled according to the `#myHeader` style definition in the head section:
