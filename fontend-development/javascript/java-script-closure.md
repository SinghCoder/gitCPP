# Java Script Closure

### JavaScript Closures

Remember self-invoking functions? What does this function do?

#### Example

var add = \(function \(\) {  
  var counter = 0;  
  return function \(\) {counter += 1; return counter}  
}\)\(\);  
  
add\(\);  
add\(\);  
add\(\);  
  
// the counter is now 3[Try it Yourself Â»](https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_function_closures5)

### Example Explained

The variable `add` is assigned to the return value of a self-invoking function.

The self-invoking function only runs once. It sets the counter to zero \(0\), and returns a function expression.

This way add becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it can access the counter in the parent scope.

This is called a JavaScript **closure.** It makes it possible for a function to have "**private**" variables.

The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function.

A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
