# DOM

The **Document Object Model**, usually referred to as the **DOM**, is an essential part of making websites interactive. It is an interface that allows a programming language to manipulate the content, structure, and style of a website. JavaScript is the client-side scripting language that connects to the DOM in an internet browser.



### What is the DOM? <a id="what-is-the-dom"></a>

At the most basic level, a website consists of an HTML document. The browser that you use to view the website is a program that interprets HTML and CSS and renders the style, content, and structure into the page that you see.

In addition to parsing the style and structure of the HTML and CSS, the browser creates a representation of the document known as the Document Object Model. This **model** allows JavaScript to access the text content and elements of the website **document** as **objects**.

JavaScript is an interactive language, and it is easier to understand new concepts by doing. Let's create a very simple website. Create an `index.html` and save it in a new project directory.
