# package-lock.json

usage



The `package-lock.json` sets your currently installed version of each package **in stone**, and `npm` will use those exact versions when running `npm install`.

This concept is not new, and other programming languages package managers \(like Composer in PHP\) use a similar system for years.

The `package-lock.json` file needs to be committed to your Git repository, so it can be fetched by other people, if the project is public or you have collaborators, or if you use Git as a source for deployments.

The dependencies versions will be updated in the `package-lock.json` file when you run `npm update`.
